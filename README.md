# discordtoolkit

Very, very simple Discord interaction interface. Consists of 2 modules:
- (New)EasyDiscord - redirects user to Discord authorization site and asks user to grant permission to view public account informations
- DiscordBot - checks if the user has specific role in selected guild

Originally the toolkit was designed for my friend.

### Additional info
DiscordBot has been moved to separate branch. It can be installed using this command: `npm install github:kantraksel/discordtoolkit#with-bot`
